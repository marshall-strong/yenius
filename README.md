# Project Highlights

One major challenge of this project was creating an audio player from scratch. I chose to utilize the HTMLAudioElement API, which gave me access to the properties and methods of ```<audio>``` elements while also giving me the flexibility of custom styling. These event listeners are applied in the ```componentDidMount``` function.

```js
  componentDidMount() {
    this.handleTimeUpdate();
    this.audio.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', this.handleMetadata);
    this.audio.addEventListener('ended', this.handleCompletion);
    this.audio.addEventListener('timeupdate', this.handleTimeUpdate);
  }
```

The ```handleTimeUpdate``` function accesses the ```currentTime``` and ```duration``` properties on the ```Audio``` instance. It formats the current time and duration to be displayed beneath the player as well as calling the ```positionTime``` function which updates the position of the handle on the progress bar.

```js
  handleTimeUpdate() {
    if (this.audio) {
      let curMins = Math.floor(this.audio.currentTime / 60);
      let curSecs = Math.floor(this.audio.currentTime - curMins * 60);
      let durMins = Math.floor(this.audio.duration / 60);
      let durSecs = Math.floor(this.audio.duration - durMins * 60);
      if (curSecs < 10) {
        curSecs = "0" + curSecs;
      }
      if (durSecs < 10) {
        durSecs = "0" + durSecs;
      }
      if (curMins < 10) {
        curMins = "0" + curMins;
      }
      this.setState({ durMins })
      if (durMins < 10) {
        durMins = "0" + durMins;
      }
      this.setState({
        currentTime: curMins + ":" + curSecs,
        durTime: durMins + ":" + durSecs,
        currentTimeUnMod: this.audio.currentTime
      })
      let ratio = this.audio.currentTime / this.audio.duration;
      if (this.outer) {
        let position = (this.outer.offsetWidth * ratio) + this.outer.offsetLeft;
        this.positionTime(position);
      }
    }
  }

  positionTime(position) {
    let outerBarWidth = this.outer.offsetWidth - this.range.offsetWidth;
    let rangeLeft = position - this.outer.offsetLeft;

    if (rangeLeft >= 0 && rangeLeft <= outerBarWidth) {
      this.range.style.marginLeft = rangeLeft + "px";
    }
    if (rangeLeft < 0) {
      this.range.style.marginLeft = "0px";
    }
    if (rangeLeft > outerBarWidth) {
      this.range.style.marginLeft = outerBarWidth + "px";
    }
  }
  ```

The audio player features an animated button that toggles between play and pause, a progress bar that shows the current position of the audio track based on the current time vs the track duration, and the ability for the user to click the progress bar to seek. These features are created by utilizing local react state inside of the ```PlayPage``` component as well as handling a user's interactions with the progress bar.

```js
  togglePlay() {
    this.setState({ play: !this.state.play }, () => {
      this.state.play ? this.audio.play() : this.audio.pause();
    });
  }

  handleMouseMove(e) {
    this.positionTime(e.pageX)
    this.audio.currentTime = (e.pageX - this.outer.offsetLeft) / this.outer.offsetWidth * this.audio.duration;
  }

  handleMouseDown(e) {
    window.addEventListener('mousemove', this.handleMouseMove);
    window.addEventListener('mouseup', this.handleMouseUp);
  }

  handleMouseUp(e) {
    window.removeEventListener('mousemove', this.handleMouseMove);
    window.removeEventListener('mouseup', this.handleMouseUp);
  }

```

Additionaly, an ```onEnded``` event listener is applied to the audio track, which allows for a "Meditation Completion" to be created when the user finishes listening to a meditation.

```js
  handleCompletion() {
    this.setState({ play: false })
    let meditationCompletion = {
      userPackId: this.props.currentUp.id,
      meditationId: this.props.currentMed.id
    }
    this.props.action(meditationCompletion);
  }
```

# To Do

* Edit audio player to function more closely to the headspace audio player
* Implement meditation completion timeline on the user's profile page


# SCRATCH

Production: https://yenius--rails6-api.herokuapp.com/

Guide for deployment:
_[A Rock Solid, Modern Web Stackâ€”Rails 5 API + ActiveAdmin + Create React App on Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/a-rock-solid-modern-web-stack)_
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql

_[ActiveAdmin](https://activeadmin.info/0-installation.html#setting-up-active-admin)_

## Development environment
seed development:
`heroku local:run rails db:seed`

run:
`rails start`

The `rails start` command is configured in `lib/tasks/start.rake`.
`heroku` commands are executed by the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI).
heroku reads `Procfile.dev` and starts the tasks:

- `web: PORT=3000 yarn --cwd client start`
  Runs the frontend on a local Node server on port 3000
  Access the client at http://localhost:3000 in your browser
- `api: PORT=3001 bundle exec rails s`
  Run the backend on a local Rails server on port 3001
  Access ActiveAdmin via the API, at http://localhost:3001/admin

## Style

Use _[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)_ framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks (Requires _[python](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/)_)
UPDATE: pre-commit should now only run Prettier the /client directory
/client directory uses Prettier and ESLint to format code as a pre-commit hook




Since this app will ultimately be deployed to Heroku, we should use [Heroku local](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-local) for development so that our dev environment more closely resembles our production environment.

# credentials
DEV: Heroku local reads environmental variables from .env
PROD: Heroku stores environmental variables in the config vars. For reference, these values have been locally exported to .env.prod

# seeding database
DEV: `heroku local:run rails db:seed`
PROD: `heroku run rake db:migrate db:seed`

# resetting database
DEV: `heroku local:run rails db:drop && heroku local:run rails db:create && heroku local:run rails db:migrate && heroku local:run rails db:seed`
PROD: `heroku restart && heroku pg:reset DATABASE --confirm yenius--rails6-api && heroku run rake db:migrate && heroku run rake db:seed`
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql

# deploying
DEV: `heroku local -f Procfile.dev -e .env`
PROD: `git push heroku main`, `heroku run rake db:migrate`, `heroku run rails db:seed`


# Counter Cache
The Rails API uses a counter cache to store each User's authored comments.
https://blog.appsignal.com/2018/06/19/activerecords-counter-cache.html
The counter_cache: option is specified on the belongs_to side of the association (Comment), and the symbol passed (:authored_comments_count) is the name of the field that will be added to the has_many model (User).
`belongs_to :author, class_name: :User, foreign_key: :commenting_user_id, counter_cache: :authored_comments_count`
Generate migration to add a column to the Users table
`rails g migration AddAuthoredCommentsCountToUsers authored_comments_count:integer`
Generate migration to update the existing records (avoids having to re-seed the database)
`rails g migration ResetUserAuthoredCommentsCount --force`
Run migrations (development)
`heroku local:run rails db:migrate`

# ToDo STILL

Lyrics shows "Lyrics not available, sorry" while still loading

VerseComments ("Annotations") currently display at the top of the page -- would be nice if they showed up next to the Verse in Lyrics

Style Links WITHIN Artist/Album Descriptions

Need more content on ArtistPages

ArtistIndex, SongIndex -- remove Rank numbers from Suggestions

AlbumsIndex -- do not show Samples & Interpolations

Style User Profile.

Add links to all usernames so that clicking on a user's username will redirect to the user's Profile Page.

When adding a comment, show an "avatar" square filled with user.my_color (currently just a gray circle).

If Lyrics are unavailable for a song, provide a link to the relevent Kanye song

Add Login with Google, Facebook, Twitter

# About Links!
Internal links should use a <Link> tag.
External links should use an <a> tag:
  <a
    href="https://github.com/marstrong/yenius--rails6-api"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    About Yenius
  </a>

The href attribute set to the URL of the page you want to link to
The target attribute set to _blank, which tells the browser to open the link in a new tab/window, depending on the browser's settings
The rel attribute set to noreferrer noopener to prevent possible malicious attacks from the pages you link to
